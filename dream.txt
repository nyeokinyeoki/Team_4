I have a dream a song to sing
to help me cope with anything
if you see the wonder of a fairy tale
you can take the future even
if you fail I believe in angels
something good in everything

I believe in angels
Something good in everything I see
I believe in angels
When I know the time is right for me
I'll cross the stream, I Have a Dream
